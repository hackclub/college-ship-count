We are using Docker Compose to run the application. If you need to run commands,
prefix them with `docker compose run --rm web`. For example: `docker compose run
--rm dev rails g`. Do this for migrations and other Rails commands.

This is a Rails app. When deciding what to do, consider the Rails way of doing.
Also - read the files in this app so you understand what's going on before
suggesting changes.
